Zombie Outbreak Simulation: Cellular Automata & PDE Solver
A computational physics project implementing zombie outbreak dynamics through cellular automata and partial differential equations, showcasing advanced numerical methods and visualization techniques.
üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Project Overview
This project implements the zombie outbreak model from the famous "When Zombies Attack!" paper by Munz et al., extending it from a simple ODE system to a sophisticated spatial cellular automaton simulation. The implementation demonstrates the evolution from theoretical mathematical models to practical computational physics applications.
Mathematical Foundation
The project is based on the SIZR (Susceptible-Infected-Zombie-Removed) epidemiological model:
dS/dt = Œ† - Œ≤SZ - Œ¥S
dI/dt = Œ≤SZ - œÅI - Œ¥I  
dZ/dt = œÅI + Œ∂R - Œ±SZ
dR/dt = Œ¥S + Œ¥I + Œ±SZ - Œ∂R
Where:

S: Susceptible population
I: Infected population
Z: Zombie population
R: Removed population
Œ≤: Transmission rate
œÅ: Zombification rate
Œ±: Zombie destruction rate
Œ∂: Resurrection rate
Œ¥: Natural death rate
Œ†: Birth rate
